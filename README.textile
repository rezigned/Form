This is part of Javascript Form Utilities that I developed to make form validation with js become easier.

h3. Usage

<pre>

Validator.Form('#form_id', {

    // simple style 'input name' + 'array'
    firstname: ['required'],
    email: ['email'],

    // more custom style 'input name' + 'object'
    email_confirm: {
        email: true,
        match: '#email' // make sure it match with 'email'
    },
    password: {
        required: function() {
            
            // custom validation
        }
    },

    // working with radios, checkboxes and multiple selects
    choices: {
        required: true // normally you don't have to add 'required' rule since all elements defined here has a required by default
    },


});

</pre>
