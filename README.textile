<pre>

Validator.Form('#form_id', {

    // simple style 'input name' + 'array'
    firstname: {
        rules: ['required']
    }
    email: {
        rules: ['email']
    }

    // more custom style 'input name' + 'object'
    email_confirm: {
        rules: {
            email: true,
            match: '#email' // make sure it match with 'email'
        }
    },
    password: {
        rules: {
            required: function() {

                // custom validation
            }
        }
    },

    // working with radios, checkboxes and multiple selects
    choices: {
        rules: {
            required: true // normally you don't have to add 'required' rule since all elements defined here has a required by default
        }
    },


});
